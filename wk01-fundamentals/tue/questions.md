## Normal Mode

* Finish the Hangman program we started in class.
  Complete any TODOs to add:
    * Rewrite the `win?` function to be correct.
      `win?` should return a boolean (true or false) value.
    * A game over state that tells the player if they won or lost
      and tells them the word they were trying to guess.

## BONUS / Hard Mode

* Input validation! Make it impossible for a player to guess a letter more than once.
* Give the player the option to play again or quit after the game ends.
