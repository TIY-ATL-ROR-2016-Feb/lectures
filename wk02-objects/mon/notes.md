The first project is always rough since you have little
preparation or experience in decomposing a large problem.

It feels a bit like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Jdt1rRf.gifv).

(Friendly reminder: This is the coding challenge I solved to get my first job.)

# Big Picture Goals for Week 2

--

## Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals

1. Understand method dispatch and how to use classes to create custom objects
2. Understand how to use unit testing for more maintainable, correct software
3. Understand the concept of interfaces and their relation to software design
4. Understand why we use modules for namespacing and to promote reusable code

--

## Minutiae

1. Classes, Modules, Blocks et al
2. Git
3. Minitest

2. Regexes!

3. The Wonders of *Enumerable*

If there's time, we'll OO Number Guessing Game. If not? Fine. :)

# So Tic-Tac-Toe Then ...

* I'm gonna write it from scratch.

--

* I'm sleepy so this could backfire.

---

# Regexes!

* Special sublanguage to search for and extract patterns in text.

--

* Great for most simple user input validation.

--

* Not the right tool for highly structured text.

  (I.e. HTML, programming languages, stuff with "a Grammar")

--

* Best way to write them is with some example data.

  (A particularly good tool is [http://rubular.com](http://rubular.com).)

# The Wonders of Enumerable

* Enumerable is very much your friend.

--

* Want to do something complicated on an Array, Set, or Hash?
  Start by looking for a similar method in the Enumerable docs.

--

* These methods exist on Arrays, Sets, *and* Hashes!

--

* But how does that work? Is it the same method?

--

* We'll find out soon ...

# OO Guessing Games

## Guessing Strategies

* Human
* CPU, Random
* CPU, Smart
* CPU, counting up
* CPU, counting down
