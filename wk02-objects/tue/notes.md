# First Things First

* I'm proud of y'all. I know this stuff is hard.

* Our pace is pretty crazy around here.

* Continue to trust that this will all sink in with time.

---

# It's Time

* **Objects** and **Messages**!

--

* What? Did y'all think I was gonna say "Classes"?

--

* Okay. Those too.

--

* Also, unit testing things!

---

# The Whole "Object Oriented" Thing ...

* Everything we've been working with this whole time
  really is just an object!

* Object(n): A specific data type guaranteed to understand
  a certain set of messages.

* Some interesting methods: .object_id, .class, .ancestors

* Some interesting magic: .send

# Classes Recap

3 different pieces to classes:

--

1. Definining them, e.g. `class Foo ..... end`

--

2. Building them,   e.g. `toy = Foo.new`

--

3. Using them,      e.g. `toy.explode!(maybe_an_arg_too)`

--

Off the top of my head, 7 classes I can think of seem kind of special **but aren't**:

1. Booleans
2. Fixnums
3. Floats
4. Strings
5. Symbols
6. Arrays
7. Hashes

# So Unit Testing

### What?

Code that "exercises" some other piece of our code and makes sure it works a certain way.

--

### Why?

To enable changing code without fear. I.e. To make maintenance more possible in the face of constant change.

--

### Types or Tests?

Both if possible! (Though I do believe in "exploratory" coding.)
