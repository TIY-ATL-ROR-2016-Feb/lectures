In this directory, you'll find a file called `tests.rb`.
It contains unit tests for tonight's homework which you can run with `ruby tests.rb`.

For this assignment, copy the `tests.rb` file into
a folder for today's homework in your labs directory.

Your task will be to add `coffee.rb` and `human.rb` files to that folder
and write code in those files such that the tests pass.

The general workflow when you have tests is:

* Run the tests (with `ruby tests.rb` in this case)
* Pick the first failure.
* Try to write code to make the test pass.
