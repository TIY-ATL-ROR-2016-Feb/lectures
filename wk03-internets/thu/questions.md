# codechamp

## Description

Pull and aggregate commit statistics from Github!

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Be able to make HTTP requests from Ruby
* Be able to work with the nested JSON responses that most APIs return
* Have some understanding of Authentication through Request Headers

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* HTTParty (or similar) for making requests
* Parsed JSON responses

## Details

### Deliverables

* A new git repo under your account called "codechamp"!

### Requirements

Running `bundle exec ruby lib/codechamp.rb` should:

* Prompt the user for an auth token
* Ask the user what org/repo to get data about from github
* Print a table of contributions ranked in various ways
* Ask the user if they'd like to fetch another or quit.

Start by testing with a small repo like:

`kingcons/coleslaw`
`sinatra/sinatra`

Then maybe later try big repos like:

`ruby/ruby`
`seattlerb/minitest`
`rails/rails`

## Normal Mode

Get the list of [contributions][contributors] for the specified repo.
Get the information on lines added, deleted, and the commit count.
Note: You don't have to track contributions by week, just sum them to get a total.

[contributors]: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/#contributors

Once all the contributions have been collected for a repo, offer to sort
the users by:

1) lines added
2) lines deleted
3) total lines changed
4) commits made

Then print the commit counts in a table as below:

```
## Contributions for 'owner/repo'

Username      Additions     Deletions     Changes
User 1            13534          2954        6249
User 2             6940           913        1603
...
```

Finally, ask the user if they'd like to sort the data differently,
fetch another repo, or quit.

## Hard Mode

* Allow the user to specify just an organization. Get data for *all* it's
  repos and aggregate the data to rank the members of the organization.
  Be mindful of rate limits!

## Nightmare Mode

Read the Github docs on [Pagination][pagination] and the Link Header in
particular. Ensure that you retrieve *all* the data. Try testing this
on a large repo like `rails`
