## Deploy All The Things!

Deploy your weekend project to Heroku referring to the [Heroku Guide][hrg]
and lecture notes as needed.

Ensure that Normal Mode is working as intended. Afterwards, pick something from
Hard Mode, maybe Votes (which we covered in class) or link deletion and get it
working!
