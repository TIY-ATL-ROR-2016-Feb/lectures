## Quick Reminder on File Storage

We usually don't want to store files on our App servers.
In fact, production services will have different servers
dedicated to database work, file serving, and Web app serving.

So where will we store our files?

--

We'll store them on S3! Three good reasons:

1. S3 is faster than Rails at serving static assets (i.e. images, files).
2. Heroku is "horizontally scalable". I.e. Just run more servers to
   meet demand. But this means you can't store the files on the filesystem
   because the other servers wouldn't be able to get to them. If you're worried
   about sharing data via the database, it is actually hosted on another
   machine in production anyway.
3. It's really cheap and durable. :D

---

## A bit about S3

S3 has a [Free Tier][free-s3]. So ... Good News.

Sign up! Cancel it anytime you want.

* You'll get an Access Key and Secret Key, like most APIs.
* Files are stored in "buckets" and you can think of a bucket as a cross
  between a ruby hash and a hard disk that's infinitely big.
* Files can be privately or publicly visible.

**Don't forget to create a bucket!**

[free-s3]: https://aws.amazon.com/free/

---

## So file uploads then ...

**tl;dr version**

1. We need to sign up for an account with AWS.
2. We need to create a bucket. Take note of what server it's on.
  * (The bucket can be created in the AWS admin console or with the `aws-sdk` gem.)
3. Add your AWS Access Key and Secret Key to a `.env` file. Don't forget to set
   them on Heroku with `heroku config:set`!
4. Put the `.env` file in `.gitignore` so you don't accidentally commit it!
5. Add some gems (`aws-sdk < 2.0`, `dotenv in dev, test`, `paperclip`) ...
6. Add an [initializer for paperclip][init-paper]. Rails runs these when
   we start the server to configure our gems.
7. Add some paperclip fields to a model with `rails g paperclip your-model attachment-name`. Migrate!
8. Add `has_attachment :attachment-name` to your model and a paperclip validation
   for either content name or content type. Or else ...

Or you could dig up footage on the internet of me crying. I'm sure it's out there.

Sidenote: I *had to* read all of these (and more) last night, after I got home
at 9, testing out various things just trying to find the *simplest* way to do this.
I tried another gem before paperclip, carrierwave, that ... well, let's not even
go into it. Long story short, experimentation and digging are a big part of life
as a developer.

## Introducing Jbuilder

For very simple responses, we've seen that you can just write
`render json: { foo: @bar }, status: :whatever` and sometimes
that is the best approach!

But often you'll want to construct JSON more carefully or build
larger responses. When that happens, you don't want to use `render json: ...`
It sort of becomes like writing a *view* in your controller, mixing logic
about the **presentation** of data versus **management** of data.

As the response gets more complicated, you should use a [JBuilder][jbuilder] view!
This article is a decent reference: [how to jbuilder][how-to-jbuilder].

## Remember your status codes!

**Note:** `render` takes a `status: :status_name`
option that recognizes the following [codes][status-codes].
In RESTful API design, we try very hard to send back an
appropriate status code so the developers making requests know
what happened on the server.

Popular codes:

* 200 - OK, that went well
* 201 - Created, cool we made that for you
* 202 - Accepted, we did what you asked us to (often used with PUT/updates)
* 204 - No Content (may be appropriate after DELETE-ing)
* 401 - Unauthenticated, you better login
* 403 - Unauthorized, you don't have permission to do that
* 404 - Page Not Found, sorry this object doesn't exist
* 422 - Unprocessable Entity, your data is garbage buddy

## Let's Talk about Workflow with Other Teams

* You're responsible for data. You need to document your APIs!
  Have a README that lists your routes, what they do, what data
  they return, and any expected parameters.

* It's important to let the other teams have an idea of what
  data you'll provide soon so they can start working.
  They can mock up test data if they know something about
  what your requests and responses look like. You may want
  to write the docs *first* and then write the rails code!

* There is also room for discussion about what part of the "work"
  (I.e. computation) is done on the frontend vs backend. Think about
  what each other's responsibilities are!
  
* Keep in mind the best way to debug the API if someone says "it doesn't work"
  is often to use `heroku logs --tail` and get them to try their request again.
  Watch the logs and see if it causes an error!
