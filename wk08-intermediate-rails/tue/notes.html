## We're Learning Crazy Amounts

![Another Wonderful Journey](http://i.imgur.com/ZvwZAYWg.jpg)

Yesterday reminded me of [this](https://twitter.com/yminsky/status/662778190755192832)

## Today's Agenda

Meeting from 12:30-1:30

Need about an hour to prep some ActionCable/WebSockets stuff with JD

--

Topics:

* Mass Assignment and Strong Params
  * (We'll start by refactoring our users controller a teensy bit.)
* Testing Associations with Fixtures
  * We'll hit this while adding posts (and maybe comments) to markit.

--

After the 11 o'clock break:

* The Asset Pipeline
  * What Rails does to get CSS and Javascript on the page
* Styling with Materialize
  * OMG

---

## Mass Assignment ...

It turns out that when doing `Model.new` or `Model.create`,
we don't have to list out each column `Model.new(foo: bar, etc)`.
We can actually just pass in a hash where the keys are attributes
on the model and the values are what we want to set them to.
E.g. `Model.new(params_hash)`

--

This is called Mass Assignment. It's very convenient *if* the parameters
you receive in the controller have the same names as the database columns
you want to store them in.

--

Unfortunately, just taking all the params and shoving them right into the
database without asking questions isn't very secure. Say if you had an
`admin` boolean column on your user model and did this in the `edit` method...

---

## Leads to Strong Params

Then anybody could make themselves a site-level admin if they sent the right
params to the controller. Something like this [happened to Github][github-sec]
a few years back, which prompted the Rails core team to say "Hmm, if really
talented programmers are still messing this up, we should make it harder
to mess up." Enter strong params.

--

Rails will now *error* if you try to pass in the params directly to `Foo.new`
or `Foo.create`. However, there is a straightforward way to specify what params
your controller will accept and then retrieve them. For example, you could define
a method in your controller like...

--

```
def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:email, :full_name, :password)
end
```
... and then in your controller's create and update methods
you can simply write

```
@user = User.new(user_params)
or
@user.update(user_params)
```

## Moar Tests!

Let's write some tests for posts. But first a quick thought.

It might seem like we didn't get a ton of code written yesterday.
Or like testing "slowed us down". But consider the following:

--

* It's very unlikely we will break the code by accident

--

* Someone new to the project can start making changes quickly

--

* It was easy to refactor the controller to use strong params and check it

--

* I never tested anything by hand with Postman or the Browser yesterday...
  * But I bet if we did, it would "just work"

--

The value in tests is cumulative, or maybe it's like compound interest,
the point is the bigger your project gets, the more valuable they are.
And while they may slow you down a little in the earliest stages, they
more than pull their weight once you're further down the line.

---

## The Asset Pipeline

A Rails feature that's been behind the scenes *this whole time*.
The [Asset Pipeline][assets] is in charge of CSS and JS files
used in our Rails projects. Not relevant to APIs but important for
sites where we build the views!

[assets]: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html

--

When developing locally, we're mostly interested in the asset pipeline to get
JS and CSS files loaded in the `<head>` of our views.

The Asset Pipeline decides what js and css to include via ["manifests"](manifests).
For an example, we can look at `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`

--

There are some fancier things the asset pipeline does that we should just briefly touch on ...

---

### Asset Pipeline - High-Level Goals

* Concatenate assets - i.e. Put files together so pages load faster
  * A request for 1 big file is faster than 10 requests for little files

* Minify/Uglify assets - Compress or shrink the size of files by any available means.
  * CSS can get whitespace and indentation ripped out.
  * JS can take out whitespace, one letter variable names, many other tricks.

---

### Asset Pipeline - More High-Level Goals

* All assets are "fingerprinted" for caching.
  * Asset pipeline generates copies in `public/assets` when Rails starts.
    * (Only when `RAILS_ENV=production` or we run `rake assets:precompile`)
  * All files are named with a hash (unique ID) generated from the file contents.
    * This way browsers/routers can cache the file but as soon as the contents
      change, Rails serves a version with diff name, invalidating the cache.

--

And if you think this is mildly insane for a simple website, oh do I have some
blog articles for you! (Especially [this one][packaging-dystopia].)

Turns out even building and deploying software is messy as hell these days.
Ask front end folks how they feel about build tools. Go on. Just ask.

## Why The Trouble?

Because it lets us use nice javascript libraries and (today) CSS Frameworks!

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) was all the rage for a time but there
are so many sites out there using Bootstrap now, you won't stand out a lick.
We'll use Materialize to be a little different. There are plenty of good
Rails+Bootstrap tutorials anyhow. Remember, maximum control and the best
odds of standing out come from doing some styling work of your own.

For example, a good graduate portfolio looks [like this][rickard-rocks].

--

Think Rickard had a hard time getting hired? ... Right.
He also did very well in the class, had awesome projects, etc.
But a good portfolio site certainly will get more calls back.

## Materialize & Rails

Google published some Material Design guidelines a year or two back.
Then they released a [CSS framework][materialize] that makes it relatively
easy for your site to follow the guidelines.

[materialize]: http://materializecss.com/

--

Bootstrap and Materialize involve JS for some of their nice UI components
to work though and integrating them with the Asset Pipeline can involve
some [complicated trickery][material-rails].

--

Thankfully, there are gems for adding them to a Rails project in a more
straightforward way. So *here we go*!

[material-rails]: http://blog.silvabox.com/materialize-on-rails-4-with-bower-and-heroku/

---

## Make It Go Plz

tl;dr

1. Add `materialize-sass` to the gemfile.
2. Replace Rails default stylesheet `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`
   with a materialize SASS/scss file `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`
   containing the line `@import "materialize";`.
   You may optionally tweak the colors as shown in their docs.
3. Add the Materialize JS code to your Rails JS manifest in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` like so: `//= require materialize-sprockets`.

You can now use all the magic in materialize!

--

For example ...

## Materialize Improvements

We can now use CSS classes as shown in the examples on Materialize
to easily achieve a ton of different effects on our site.

See especially:
* [Easy grids][grids]
* [CSS helpers][helpers]
* [Navbars][navbars]
* [Icons][icons]

Javascript powered bits like:
* [Collapsibles][collapsibles]
* [Mediaboxes][mediaboxes]
* [Tabs][tabs]

And hella other useful components.

[grids]: http://materializecss.com/grid.html
[helpers]: http://materializecss.com/helpers.html
[navbars]: http://materializecss.com/navbar.html
[icons]: http://materializecss.com/icons.html
[collapsibles]: http://materializecss.com/collapsible.html
[mediaboxes]: http://materializecss.com/media.html
[tabs]: http://materializecss.com/tabs.html

## Dat Application Layout Tho...

All is for naught if we don't thoughtfully design an
overall layout for our site though.

--

Y'all might need to help me out here but let's try
to add a partial template for a navbar up top.
We'll put it in `app/views/shared/_nav.html.erb`
and call it in the application layout.

I threw a rough sketch up [here][nav-sketch]...

--

Note that spending a little extra time customizing your
[color palette][colors] on your site can make a big difference
to how things pop. See also: [the showcase][showcase]
