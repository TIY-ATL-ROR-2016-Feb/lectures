### Final Projects

2 big notes here:

1. Group projects are *strongly* encouraged for the best possible final project.
   Any individual projects need sign off by *ALL* of the instructors.

2. If you have a final project idea you want to create, awesome.
   You will be able to pitch your idea to your fellow --students-- hackers
   later this week, probably Wednesday afternoon at 2pm but that time isn't final.

   If you don't have an idea, fantastic! See if any of the pitches grab you.

**All final project groups should be finalized by 5pm on Friday.**

Questions? Reflections? Things we can do better?

### Where We're Headed

Three big topics this week:

* Mailers
  * And why it's better to sign up for an
    email service than run a mailserver ourselves.
* Background Jobs
  * Because there are certain things that just take too long
    (or are too unimportant) to be a web request.
  * Emails and Data Importing are classic examples of background jobs
    we'll see.
* Javascript (maybe)
  * Which isn't my strong suit but we can get a feel for the basics.

## The Final Stretch

What are we building this week?

* No *coding* Homework tonight but you will have to broaden your mind.

* I'll be prototyping and planning tonight. Pondering hour and a half lectures
  each morning followed by reviewing pull requests and assigning cards for
  the next evening.
