## The Joy of Programming

You are at a turning point from being students into being engineers.

You've been writing code nonstop for 8 weeks now. Increasingly, you
will need to be self-directed in how you grow as a programmer.

There is also a tremendous amount of joy in this process as you can
guide yourself towards topics and projects which excite you.

Tonight, choose a blog post or lecture from some of my suggested
favorites and broaden your mind a bit. Also, maybe follow some tweeps.
